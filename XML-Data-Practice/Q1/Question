In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. 
This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, 
and was originally compiled by the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. 
Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). 
Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) 
and/or cities (with names and populations). The XML data is here. 

Write a DTD for the XML data set.

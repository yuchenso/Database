Q1. For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades. 

select H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
from
    Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2,
    (select ID1, ID2
    from Likes
    where ID2 not in (select ID1 from Likes)) D
where H1.ID = D.ID1 and H2.ID = D.ID2


Q2. For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C. 

select H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
from
    Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3, 
    (select L1.ID1 as ID1, L1.ID2 as ID2, L2.ID2 as ID3
    from Likes L1, Likes L2
    where L1.ID2 = L2.ID1 and L2.ID2 <> L1.ID1) D
where H1.ID = D.ID1 and H2.ID = D.ID2 and H3.ID = D.ID3


Q3. Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades. 

select name, grade
from Highschooler
where Highschooler.ID not in 
        (select H1.ID as ID
        from Friend F, Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2
        where F.ID1 = H1.ID and F.ID2 = H2.ID and H1.grade = H2.grade)

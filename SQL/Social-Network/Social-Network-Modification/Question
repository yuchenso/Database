Q1. It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler. 

delete from Highschooler
where grade = 12

Q2. If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple. 

delete from Likes
where not exists (select * from Likes as L2 where Likes.ID1 = L2.ID2 and Likes.ID2 = L2.ID1)
      and exists (select * from Friend as F1 where F1.ID1 = Likes.ID1 and F1.ID2 = Likes.ID2)

Q3. For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.) 

insert into Friend
    select distinct F1.ID1 as ID1, F2.ID2 as ID2
    from Friend F1, Friend F2
    where F1.ID2 = F2.ID1 and F1.ID1 <> F2.ID2
    
    except
    
    select FF1.ID1, FF1.ID2
    from
        (select distinct F1.ID1 as ID1, F2.ID2 as ID2
        from Friend F1, Friend F2
        where F1.ID2 = F2.ID1 and F1.ID1 <> F2.ID2) FF1, Friend FF2
    where FF1.ID1 = FF2.ID1 and FF1.ID2 = FF2.ID2
